# Hybrid-Prediction-Model-Diabetes
Handling class imbalance on a medical dataset using ML and sampling techniques

### Abstract

Diabetes mellitus is a fast-growing disease
affecting millions of people around the globe. According to the
statistics obtained from the International Diabetes Federation,
the growth of diabetic cases around the world is estimated to
be around 10.2% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9% (700
million) by 2045. Machine learning techniques can be used for
early diagnosis of diabetes so that individuals can adapt to
better lifestyle habits and diet plan to prevent further
complications of symptoms. In this paper we have implemented
an efficient model to classify type-2 diabetes using a hybrid
approach. The dataset which is relatively imbalanced with
respect to the number of diabetic or non-diabetic individuals
was obtained from the Biostatistics program of Vanderbilt
University, USA which contains parameters like Glucose, Age,
Cholesterol, Weight, Waist/Hip ratio of 390 African-American
individuals. The features from the dataset were obtained by
filter and wrapper methods. The dataset was balanced by
applying oversampling and undersampling methods. A voting
ensemble model consisting of 5 algorithms was then used as a
classifier with model validation done using stratified K-fold
technique. The modelâ€™s performance was assessed using recall,
precision, F1 score and accuracy. The results obtained by
comparison of the models with and without sampling have
shown significant improvements in recall. The main motive is
to improve recall and have reasonable precision at the same
time.

The work has been published as a research paper in the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applied Network Technologies (ICMLANT).
